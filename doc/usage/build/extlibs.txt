The easy way to setup third-party libraries:

	1. Visit "https://github.com/ToyAuthor/ToyBoxSDK" and check
	   "ToyBoxSDK/lib/readme.txt" and make sure your environment is supported.
	   You need "the hard way", if your environment is not supported.

	2. Download "https://github.com/ToyAuthor/ToyBoxSDK".
	3. Read SFML wiki to setup environment.(optional)
	4. Edit "ToyBox/cmake/toy_SetThirdPartyLibraryPath.cmake".
	   And write down the path you put down ToyBoxSDK.


The hard way to do the same job:

	1. Download and build those third-party libraries by yourself.
	2. Edit "ToyBox/cmake/toy_SetThirdPartyLibraryPath.cmake".
	   Edit every each third-party project's path.
